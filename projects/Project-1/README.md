# SDI Blended Project 1 Scaffold

This program is designed to take in the top 5 (although it lists 10) cryptocurrencies based on marketcap and displays them. 

On the next area, there is a search box where you can see what cryptocurrency is based on rank. Enter a number from 1-100 (rank of crypto) to see what that crypto is based on the rank provided. Then it adds that crypto to the watchlist and displays all the data pertaining to it.
